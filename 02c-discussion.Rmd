## Discussion: Algorithmic Co-Design Insights

The preceding analysis, while focusing on two specific classes of statistical methods, provides a fertile ground for a broader discussion on successfully accelerating statistical algorithms. Comparing Falkon's implementation of Kernel Methods and XGBoost's GPU-accelerated histograms, we identify common patterns with wider implications for the field of computational statistics.

A primary theme emerging from the analysis is the primacy of algorithmic co-design. It becomes clear that hardware acceleration is rarely a "plug-and-play" solution. In both cases, the most critical performance gains were unlocked only after fundamental algorithmic transformation had taken place: the Nyström approximation and iterative CG solver for Kernel Methods, and the histogram method for XGBoost. That goes to show that hardware can only accelerate a process that has first been made algorithmically suitable for parallelism. This initial step reshapes the computational profile of the problem, systematically replacing complex CPU-bound logic like direct matrix inversion or sorting with simple, regular, data-parallel operations such as matrix-vector products and histogram aggregation. This shift in the nature's problem is a common theme in high-performance computing, and this chapter demonstrates its direct application in a statistical context.

The strategic use of intermediate representation is also a common pattern that emerges. Both solutions rely on transforming raw data into a smaller, computationally convenient structure: the low-rank Nyström matrices for Falkon, and the gradient-and-Hessian histograms for XGBoost. The principle of performing the bulk of the computationally demanding work on these compact representations makes sense, as it minimizes data movement and improves efficiency.

Lastly, it also becomes evident that the path to acceleration requires navigating both numerical and architectural challenges simultaneously. The promise of GPU speed-ups is tied to the use of lower-precision arithmetic, which introduces tangible risk of numerical instability that both Falkon and XGBoost must actively manage with mixed-precision schemes. Likewise, both solutions demonstrate a deep awareness of the hardware's memory hierarchy, using explicit Out-of-Core and memory-aware strategies. All of that is to say that a successful implementation must treat the target hardware not as a black box, but as a complex system whose architectural and numerical properties must be taken into account.

The most profound gains in computational statistics are achieved through an integrated co-design process between the underlying statistical algorithm and hardware architecture. The patterns observed here suggest that reshaping statistical theory with algorithmic innovations, we can create computational structures that modern parallel hardware can exploit at unprecedented scale, opening new avenues for research and application.
