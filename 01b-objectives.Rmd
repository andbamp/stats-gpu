## Thesis Objectives and Structure

The central goal of this thesis is to demonstrate how GPU acceleration provides a practical and powerful solution to the computational bottlenecks inherent in modern statistical methods. We aim to bridge the conceptual gap between the theoretical principles of high-performance computing and their concrete application to statistical practice. In this journey we investigate the nuances and trade-offs of implementing advanced, large-scale statistical methods on modern hardware, moving from theory to application. Our inquiry is built upon a methodological framework of three interconnected pillars, using examples such as Kernel Methods, Gradient Boosting, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to exemplify the challenges and opportunities at the frontier of computational statistics.

The theoretical analysis is conducted on **Chapter \@ref(theory), "Algorithmic Pathways to GPU-Accelerated Statistics"**. This chapter provides the analytical foundation for the thesis by dissecting key statistical algorithms into their core computational components. By analyzing the complexity and memory access patterns of these components, we identify the specific operations that create performance bottlenecks and reveal inherent opportunities for parallelism. This provides a crucial rationale for *why* a given method is amenable to GPU acceleration.

The empirical validation of these concepts is then explored in **Chapter \@ref(practice), "Benchmarking Statistical Solutions on GPU"**. This chapter presents applied research that benchmarks state-of-the-art, GPU-accelerated libraries against their CPU-based counterparts. Through rigorous experimentation, we quantify the tangible, real-world impact of these parallelization strategies. This not only validates the theoretical analysis but also furnishes concrete evidence of the performance gains available to practitioners.

Finally, a pedagogical overview of the engineering that underpins these solutions is presented in **Chapter \@ref(programming), "An Introduction to GPU Programming"**. This chapter addresses the practical question of *how* these high-performance tools are constructed. By providing a brief, accessible introduction to GPU programming paradigms, this section serves to demystify the development process for a statistical audience.

Together, these chapters aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of GPU acceleration in modern computational statistics, guiding the reader from architectural foundations to algorithmic strategies and, finally, to practical application.
